# N_Queens
-**The N-Queens problem** is a classic puzzle or mathematical problem that involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and the objective is to find a configuration where no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Project Overview
- Welcome to our **N-Queens game project**, a challenging single-player experience with three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The game leverages the **backtracking algorithm** to ensure optimal solutions for the players. This initiative is part of an assignment for our Algorithm Design and Analysis class.
- The process of creating this game was managed using Trello where tasks were assigned, in progress and done.

## Technology Stack:
- **Backend**:Developed in C# for ASP.NET Core web application (Model-View-Controller).
- **Frontend**:Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive user interface.
- **Design**:Created using Figma.

## Difficulty Levels:

- **Easy**: Enjoy a relaxed gaming experience with no timer and the option to receive hints.
- **Medium**: A moderate challenge without a timer and hints for those seeking a balanced puzzle-solving experience.
- **Hard**: Embrace the ultimate challenge with a timer to increase the intensity, and no hints for a truly demanding puzzle-solving adventure.

# N-Queens Swift Implementation

This is a simple Swift project that utilizes the N-Queens algorithm to solve a chess game with a specified number of queens. The project includes two levels: an easy level and a hard level.

## How to Play

The game features two levels:

1. *Easy*: In this level, your task is to place the queens on the board in a way that avoids any conflicts. You can place the queens by clicking on the board.

![easy](https://github.com/elvirametaj/N_Queens/assets/118827510/6840f5ff-2f8a-411a-8d64-6317a3006aa9)

2. *Hard*: This is a more challenging version of the game, where you have a limited time to solve it. Use the algorithm to place the queens without conflicts before the time runs out.

## Advantages

- The N-Queens algorithm is employed to ensure an optimal solution for the game.
- The two levels of the game offer different experiences, ranging from easy to challenging.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in the Swift language using a simple graphical interface. The N-Queens algorithm is used to place the queens on the board and solve the game. A timer has been added to the hard level to make the game more challenging.
