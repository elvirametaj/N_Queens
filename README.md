# N_Queens
-**The N-Queens problem** is a classic puzzle or mathematical problem that involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and the objective is to find a configuration where no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Project Overview
- Welcome to our **N-Queens game project**, a challenging single-player experience with three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The game leverages the **backtracking algorithm** to ensure optimal solutions for the players. This initiative is part of an assignment for our Algorithm Design and Analysis class.
