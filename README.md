# N_Queens
-**The N-Queens problem** is a classic puzzle or mathematical problem that involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and the objective is to find a configuration where no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
